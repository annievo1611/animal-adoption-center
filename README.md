# animal-adoption-center
A final project of my Java class, which I have to use interfaces and/or abstract classes with appropriate methods.

The project is a simulation of an animal adoption center where users can choose the animal they want to adopt from categories such as Dogs, Cats, and Others, allow it to perform activities and adopt it. Program output is text-based.
